You have been tasked by a client to write a note taking application to suit her specific set of needs. She requires the ability to write an arbitrary number of text based notes and store them on her phone. Each note should have a title and body of text associated with it as well as the time at which it was created. After creating a note, the user should be able to go back and edit the information contained in it and also delete it from the list of notes in the app. 

Your client is very forgetful and to better help her remember about each note, she requests two special features. First, she must have the ability to choose a photo from the photo library and attach it to a note. Second, she wants to be able to email notes from the app to friends and family members so that they can help her.

Your grade on this project will take many factors into consideration. First and foremost, your app needs to meet all of the requirements that the client has set forth. The way that you  organize the functionality of your app must make it simple for her to accomplish the tasks that she wants. Your app should also be fast and never lock-up while using it. Since this is a CS course, the way that you organize your classes and the quality of your code will be of the utmost importance.

## Due: October 17th at midnight

You will be submitting your projects using Github. Create a private repository for your project on Github and add me as a collaborator. Please name the repository according to the following format: \<your\_uni>\_w3101\_ios. My Github user name is: `columbia-w3101-fall2014`. 

Only commits before the due date will be considered. If you are unable to complete the project on time, you can hand it in late. However, there will be a full letter grade deduction from your score for each day that the project is late.
