You have been tasked by a client to write a note taking application to suit her specific set of needs. She requires the ability to write an arbitrary number of text based notes and store them on her phone. Each note should have a title and body of text associated with it as well as the time at which it was created. After creating a note, the user should be able to go back and edit the information contained in it and also delete it from the list of notes in the app. 

Your client is a very forgetful person and to help her remember more about each note she wants to have two special features. First, she must have the ability to take a picture with the phone's camera and attach it to a note. Second, she wants the app to save her location from the when the note was created and to be able to view that location on a map.

Your grade on this project will take many factors into consideration. First and foremost, your app needs to meet all of the requirements that the client has set forth. The way that you  organize the functionality of your app must make it simple for her to accomplish the tasks that she wants. Your app should also be fast and never lock-up while using it. Since this is a CS course, the way that you organize your classes and the quality of your code will be of the utmost importance.
